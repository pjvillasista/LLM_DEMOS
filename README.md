# LLM Demos for Beginner Data Analysts

Welcome to the **LLM Demos for Data Analysts** repository! This repository is designed to show why learning Python—beyond SQL and data visualization—is a valuable skill for data analysts, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and AI-powered tools.

## Purpose

In today’s data landscape, SQL and data visualization are essential but often limited in their ability to handle unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and interact with advanced AI models. Python opens doors to more sophisticated analysis, data transformation, and integration with AI models, making it a powerful addition to the modern data analyst's toolkit.

## Files

- **`llm_csv_agent.ipynb`**: This notebook demonstrates how an LLM agent can assist with CSV data, showing ways to perform data exploration, cleaning, and simple analysis using natural language.
  
- **`llm_mysqldatabase.ipynb`**: This notebook shows how to interact with a MySQL database using Python and an LLM, enabling flexible querying, data extraction, and insights without the need for complex SQL knowledge.

## Requirements

To run these demos, you’ll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI API or other LLM service (where applicable)
